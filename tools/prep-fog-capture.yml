### This role is used to prep a {FOG|MAAS}-IMAGED testnode
### so that it can be used to capture an OS image for FOG.
### This playbook is needed for a couple reasons
###   - NIC configs get hard coded into the captured FOG images so nodes reimaged by FOG don't come up with network
###   - SSH host keys need to be deleted
###   - apt and cloud-init services need to be disabled

- hosts:
    - testnodes
  roles:
    - prep-fog-capture
  gather_facts: false
  become: true
