# This was ported directly from chef.  I was unable to figure out a better way
# to do this, but it seems to just be adding the user_xattr option to the root filesystem mount.
# I believe perl was used here initially because the mount resources provided by chef and ansible
# require both the name (i.e. /) and the source (UUID="<some_uuid>") to ensure it's editing the correct line
# in /etc/fstab.  This won't work for us because the root file system source (UUID or label) is different depending
# on the image used to create this node (downburst and cobbler use different images).
